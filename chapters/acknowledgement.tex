The contents of this book are based on the KAIST \textit{Programming Languages}
course. We thank PLT\sidenote{\url{https://racket-lang.org/people.html}} since
the course referred to many materials from PLT in the beginning.
We also thank every student who took the
course before. We have learned many things from the interaction with the
students, and those lessons have affected various parts of the book. In
addition, we thank all the previous and current teaching assistants of the
course. They gave opinions to the course and wrote some of the exercises in the
book. Especially, Jihyeok Park highly contributed to the course, and Jihee Park
helped us edit the exercises.

We would be delighted to receive comments and corrections, which may be sent to
\code{jaemin.hong@kaist.ac.kr}. We thank in advance everyone who will contribute
to the book in the future.
